            <h2>Running</h2>
            <p>I have been passionate about long-distance running, participating in cross-country, winter, and spring track events throughout high school. I've also competed in multiple marathons, pushing myself to constantly improve and stay active. Running gives me a sense of freedom and focus, and it's an essential part of my life.</p>

            <h2>Traveling</h2>
            <p>Traveling is another great passion of mine. So far, I have visited five countries, and each destination has been an adventure filled with learning and growth. I love exploring new cultures, trying different foods, and meeting new people. Traveling broadens my perspective and feeds my curiosity.</p>
